      I don't mind going overboard with the things you're passionate about. <br /> Just making that clear.
      <br /><br />
      Let's talk about the philosophy itself.
      <br /><br />
      This principle is based on the idea that removing excess elements enhances the clarity of concept.<br />
      Sounds nice, but it can be misused a lot.<br /> For a lack of better terms, it can be a reason for a lack of personality.<br />
      Colour, designs - intricate and complex are very much required in life. <br />
      Like everything in life, it's not always black and white. <br />
      There are grey areas where some things make sense and some things don't.<br />
      It totally depends on the context and utility.<br />
      <br /><br />
      Let's say I'm going to purchase a watch.<br />
      There are millions to choose from. I can go for the fancy ones or the ones that aren't that fancy. Totally up to me?
      <br />Cool.<br /> Now I need to think, what do I really need?<br /> A watch that shows extreme simplicity doing only the essentials the best way it can?<br />
      or get one that has an array of precious metals, rare materials and pushed the design to its ultimate and intricate beauty?
      <br /><br />Now is when I actually know what my priorities are. I can go for any. I can go for both. 
      I find that beautfiul.
      <br /><br />
      I went for a good old Casio G-Shock for complete utility usage. But I also plan to get a dress watch with beautiful design for special occasions.
      <br /><br />What does this say about me? Or us in general?
      That's something to think about.
      <br /><br />
      Look at this website for instance.<br />
      I've built beautiful sites with parallax animations and what not.<br /> But I chose this design for my own portfolio website.
      I just felt this is who I am, simple, someone who prefers minimalism and utility over complicated designs while making their site.<br />
      Mind you, I love me some jewellery. And I think I love it when it looks minimal from afar and upon closer inspection, it has beautiful engravings. <br />
      Something like the art that was very prevalent in India a thousand years ago.
      <br /><br />
      All I'm trying to say is, sometimes less is in fact more.
      "Sometimes" being the keyword here. Not always. But, sometimes.
